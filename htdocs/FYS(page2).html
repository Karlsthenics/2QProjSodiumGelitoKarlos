     			<div id="p">ROLES IN DOTA 2:</div>

     			<div id="hp">
     				In a team, there are 5 players. These players need to have a role specified to them in order for the team to synchronize with each other and therefore, win the game. There are 5 roles (which I will explain very briefly but will further explain later), namely, Position 1 (Carry), Position 2 (Semi-carry or Mid), Position 3 (Offlaner or the "space" maker), Position 4 (Roaming support or Semi-support), Position 5 (Support). These positions can be categorize by how gold dependent they are, Pos 1 (position 1) being the most dependent role on gold and Pos 5 being the least dependent role on gold (why? I will explain later).
     			</div>

     			<div id="p">POS 1:</div>

     			<div id="hp1">
                    This is the carry and when you have picked this role, you would be heavily reliant on gold. Hence it is put as pos 1, as it is the most dependent role on gold or it is the highest farm priority out of the 5 roles. You need gold as being a pos 1 relies on items (which is bought on shops or secret shops) to make the hero effective or "carry" the game. In the laning phase, these heroes are usually inactive as in the laning phase, or early game, you have little items and by being heavily reliant on items, the hero would be not that effective in the early game. Examples of pos 1 heroes are, Anti-Mage, Sven, Spectre, Medusa, etc.

     			<div id="p">POS 2:</div>

     			<div id="hp2">
                    This is the midlaner, the 2nd highest farm priority out of the 5 roles. These midlaners need to solo mid as, it needs exp and gold on the early game to disrupt the enemies farm early on the game. Furthermore, they only needs a certain item to become "mobile" (meaning, you gank; a lot on lanes and you are technically present in each lane; you rotate the map) *ganking is the act of actively moving around the map in order to kill an enemy hero*. Being mobile is that you disrupt the enemies lane for them to have a hard time farming and therefore, when they have a low farm (in other words, income of gold) because of you, your team gets an advantage as not only your enemies are underfarmed, when you disrupt their farm, you're making space for your team to farm more. Examples of pos 2 heroes are, Queen of Pain, Lina, Shadow Fiend, etc.

     			<div id="p">POS 3:</div>

     			<div id="hp3">
                    This is pos 3 or the offlaner, these heroes rely mostly on EXP over farm. Hence they are given a solo lane most of the time. I said EXP over farm as, in their lane, the offlane, it is usually a hard lane for them as the opposing team will have a pos 4 or pos 5 will make you have a hard time farming the lane. These heroes tend to be called the "initiators" as heroes like Tidehunter, Centaur, Timbersaw, and etc., have abilities that enables their team to initiate a fight and make the fight to their advantage. Furthermore, these heroes tend to be "tanky" or hard to be killed.

     			<div id="p">POS 4:</div>

     			<div id="hp4">
                    When you picked this role you're gonna be a roaming support or semi-support. These are heroes that don't need that much farm or experience as compared to your cores (cores meaning pos 1 and pos 2). But would still need a bit of items such as a Blink Dagger in order to become more effective in the laning phase. They buy little to no support items. Furthermore, in the laning phase, usually, these heroes rotate or gank around the map. Hence, their main goal in the laning phase is to, like what does the pos 2 does, disrupt the opposing team's farm or give them a hard time. Their abilities compliments on what their doing as their abilities usually what makes them so effective in rotating. Generally, most of the game they are active or mobile. Examples of heroes in pos 4 would be, Rubick, Tiny, Void Spirit, Earth Spirit, and Earthshaker.

     			<div id="p">POS 5:</div>

     			<div id="hp5">
     				These are your supports in the game. They usually help your pos 1 in lane in making their farm better. Furthermore these heroes tend to buy most if not all, of the support items present in the game (e.g. Smoke of Deceit, Dust of Apperance, Observer Wars, and Sentry Wards). Although these support items are cheap and most of the time, it is underestimated by their usefullness, play a very big role in the game. Generally, these heroes do not need that much gold and exp. As they only help their pos 1 in farming. Whether your pos 5 is effectively buying support items and effectively supporting your team (specifically pos 1), it could mean a win or loss. Their abilities Examples of pos 5 would be, Lich, Rhasta or Shadow Shaman, and Lion.

     			<div id="hp6">Knowing what position your team needs filled in the drafting phase is crucial, and knowing exactly what you need to do as your position role will help you win a lot more games. Hopefully this will help you understand the game and its importance of picking properly. So now, pick your role that fits to your liking! <br>
     			For me, I play pos 4 most of the time when I play ranked or classic games. As this is fun for me and you are not pressured with the amount of gold you have as the only thing you need is a bit of gold and exp.
