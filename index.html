	     				Dota 2 is your typical Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Game (MOBA): Gather gold and experience to dominate the enemy team; pushing lanes, towers, and ultimately, the Ancient, breaking the Ancient down causes you to win the game.
						From game mechanics, roles, drafting, to itemization, we got you covered!

					<div id="wa">What is it about?</div>

					<div id="para1">
						Dota 2 is a game of five players with two teams that are against each other on a map with two different bases. Before a match, a player has to choose a "Hero" out of the 115 different heroes there. All heroes are unique in abilities, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.  
					</div>

					<div id="para2">
						During the game, players collect experience points (or exp in short) to level up their heroes by performing different feats, such as killing another hero, creep, or neutral. or progressing closer towards the enemy base by killing defense towers. According to their performance, players can collect and earn gold. This is a very vital part of the game as earning gold will allow you to buy items for your character that can vastly improve your characters’ effetiveness in the game. The first team (team specifically called, "Radiant and "Dire") to destroy the opposing team’s base or as it is called, "ancient" will  win.

					<div id="hy">Origins:</div>

					<div id="para3">
						Dota 2 started in 2009 when the lead designer of Defense of the Ancients (or so called DOTA, DotA, or Dota), IceFrog, was hired by Valve to create a new or modernized remake of DotA for them. It was released in steam in July 2013. The game is free-to-play with the heroes or other in game element that needs to be bought or otherwise, unlock. To maintain the game, Valve introduced cosmetics, battle pass (gives you birtual goods such as, hero cosmetics and audio replacement packs), Dota Plus (which all it does is it gives you further statistics on heroes or items), these are all paid (although you can have cosmetics without buying them) but does not contribute to your gameplay and does not give you an unfair advantage. It is just for aesthetical and statistical purposes.
